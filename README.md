**Homepage Configuration/Kubernetes Deployment**

<div align="center">
    A full run-down of my Homepage dashboard configuration as well as my specific Kubernetes deployment of it.
    When using Kubernetes I combined all of Homepage's YAML configuration files into a ConfigMap.
    For all who are not using Kubernetes, I included a "configuration" folder where you can find the specific YAML per file.
